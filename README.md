This was an assingment for Code Fellows Dev Accelerator. The scope of the assingment was:
Create a small project containing the necessary test to satisfy the following specs:

As a developer,
I want to create a card with a particular suit and rank
So that I can build a deck with the created card.

As a player of a card game,
I want a deck of 52 cards
So that I can play a standard game of cards.


I worked on this project with Erik and Steve with help from Alex
